# Sudoku Solver
Chinmay Mangalwedhe

A PyGame visual of a backtracing algorithm to solve a 9x9 Sudoku Board. The program also shows the steps that the solver
takes to solve the board and shows how it "backtracks" and finds all possible values to see if it is valid according to 
the rules of sudoku.

## Usage
Download the respository and run the sudoku.py file. Make sure that all files including boards.txt are in the same 
directory.

## Running on Devices that Do Not Have PIP or PyGame
If you have PyCharm, add the PyGame module to the project structure and run the code from PyGame.
